# P42 Workflow Engine   

The P42 Workflow Engine is a flexible and extendable platform designed to handle automation of various workflows. It supports different types of workflow steps, such as conditional, loop, switch, parallel, and sequential steps, among others.

## Core Concepts

The core unit is a `WorkflowStep`, which performs an action. Input and output are represented by `IWorkflowStepInput` and `IWorkflowStepOutput` respectively. Steps can be combined in various ways to form complex workflows.

Special step types - `Conditional`, `Loop`, `Parallel`, `Sequential`, and `ExceptionHandler` steps - provide flexibility in controlling the flow of execution.

## Features

1. **Extensibility**: You can easily extend new types of steps by creating new interfaces that extend `IWorkflowStep`.
2. **Flexibility**: Includes built-in support for conditionals (if-then-else), loops, handling exceptions, and executing steps in parallel or sequential order.
3. **Robustness**: Exception handling allows workflows to fail gracefully when things go wrong.

## Getting Started

To create a new workflow, first create the individual steps. Each step is an implementation of the `IWorkflowStep` interface. Instead of implementing `IWorkflowStep` directly, you may want to use or extend one of the more specialized interfaces such as `ILoopWorkflowStep` or `IConditionalWorkflowStep`.

Once the steps have been defined, they can be combined in a `Workflow` object by adding them to the `Steps` list.

Here's an example of creating a simple workflow with a loop:

```csharp 
var workflow = new Workflow() 
{ 
    Steps = 
    { 
        new SimpleLoopWorkflowStep 
        { 
            LoopStep = new MyStep(), 
            LoopCondition = inputs => inputs.Count < 5, 
            Inputs = new List  
            { 
                // Initialize your input 
            } 
        } 
    } 
};
```




To execute the workflow, simply call the `Perform` method:
